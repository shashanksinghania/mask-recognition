# Face-Mask Detector with Artificial Intelligence
This is a program that detects if people are wearing face-masks in real-time.

This project strives to identify people who wear/do not wear face masks. Many countries have mandated the use of face-masks in public areas. This program can be used to scan and identify that. It uses opencv to scan and process the inputs and a convolutional neural network (AI) to predict results.

# Instructions
To see the system in action you can run it own your own machine (must have a webcam) or see some sample outputs in the demo_results folder. If you do not have a webcam, you can also run it on some sample data provided in the test_data folder.
If you decide to run it on your machine, make sure you have installed all dependencies. You can do so by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt 

on yout command line.
